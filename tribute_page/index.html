		<div id="tribute-info">
			<ul id="list">
				<li><div class="date">Jul 10 1856</div> - Nikola Tesla Is Born. Tesla was born to Serbian parents in the village of Smiljan, Austrian Empire near the town of Gospić, in the territory of modern-day Croatia.</li>
				<li><div class="date">1875</div> - Tesla Enrolls At Austrian Polytechnic. At the school Tesla began his studies in mechanical and electrical engineering.</li>
				<li><div class="date">1882</div> - Nikola Tesla begins working for Continental Edison. In 1882 Tesla moved to Paris, to work as an engineer for the Continental Edison Company, designing improvements to electric equipment brought overseas from Edison's ideas.</li>
				<li><div class="date">1882</div> - Tesla Identifies Magnetic Induction Field Principle. In 1882, Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle used in alternators and pioneered the use of this rotating and inducting electromagnetic field force to generate torque in rotating machines.</li>
				<li><div class="date">Jun 6 1884</div> - Tesla arrives in the United States. On 6 June 1884, Tesla first arrived in the United States, in New York City with little besides a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, a former employer.</li>
				<li><div class="date">1885</div> - Nikola Tesla quits working for Edison. Tesla claims he was offered US$50,000 (~ US$1.1 million in 2007, adjusted for inflation) if he redesigned Edison's inefficient motor and generators, making an improvement in both service and economy.</li>
				<li><div class="date">1886</div> - Nikola Tesla forms Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company. The Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing was a company formed by Nikola Tesla in 1886.</li>
				<li><div class="date">1887</div> - War of Currents era begins. During the initial years of electricity distribution, Edison's direct current was the standard for the United States and Edison was not inclined to lose all his patent royalties.</li>
				<li><div class="date">Apr 1887</div> - Nikola Tesla begins experimenting with X-Rays. In April 1887, Tesla began investigating what would later be called X-rays using his own single terminal vacuum tubes (similar to his patent No.514,170). This device differed from other early X-ray tubes in that it had no target electrode.</li>
				<li><div class="date">May 16 1888</div> - Tesla Delivers Lecture: A New System of Alternating Current Motors and Transformers. At an AIEE meeting on May 16, 1888, Nikola Tesla delivered a lecture entitled A New System of Alternating Current Motors and Transformers, describing the equipment which allowed efficient generation and use of polyphase alternating currents.</li>
				<li><div class="date">1899</div> - Tesla moves to research facility in Colorado Springs. In 1899, Tesla decided to move and began research in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he would have room for his high-voltage, high-frequency experiments.</li>
				<li><div class="date">Jan 7 1943</div> - Nikola Tesla Dies. Tesla died of heart failure alone in room 3327 of the New Yorker Hotel, on 7 January 1943.</li>
